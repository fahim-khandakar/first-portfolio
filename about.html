            <p class="about_p">Hey viewers! I am <b> Fahim Khandaker.</b>  I am a hafez and also a student of programming.<br/>

                I am interested in becoming a computer programmer because I love using computers and can already design simple programs.  This work is my favorite. I have been interested in computers since I was about ten years old.  I am currently learning advanced web programming and it comes easily to me.  I think I can design helpful or entertaining programs that people will enjoy watching. And everyone will like it. <br/>
              
                So keep me in your prayers to become a professional programmer.
